# What is Open Source? ðŸ™‚

> Empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source work, since in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups, not from large, structured efforts.

Iâ€™m a student, and Itâ€™s been 5 months since I started studying tech as a Programmer. Open source is fascinating and full of great programmers and communities. I want to be a part of this community and want to contribute my valuable code and my handwork, So letâ€™s back to the main Question and how it affected me?


What is open source
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open-source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible â€” anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

Open-source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open-source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

This is the technical definition now come to my own â€” For me, it is an opportunity to meet new people and work with great skilled people. Where I live, I found no one like me who was as interested in tech as Iâ€™m. So for me to get the opportunity to work with a skilled programmer will be great.

Why I started open source
As I told you, where I live, I found no one like me who was as interested in tech. Last Jan 2022, I started studying how can I contribute to open source and what will be the technology I should learn. I got to know many things in this process.

My process with Open Source in Jan 2022

1. get up in the morning
2. open my laptop even before making my bed and brushing my teeth
3. start to research how to contribute and where to contribute
4. Learning technologies intensely as fast as I can, so I can start contributing soon as soon
5. Cold emailing to dozens of people daily and hardly someone replied these days
6. Sleeping with unsatisfied eyes

Lately, I realized, I wasnâ€™t eligible that time to contribute to those big GitHub repos and I should work even harder to understand this metadata code. I started working on my code writing and DSA and another development tech. Yesterday, I got an offer for an internship with a stipend of 30K, I realized the journey just started. If I work even harder and smarter then It will only improve. And It will make a compound effect at the end. Iâ€™m more motivated now to learn more

And will meet you soon! bie

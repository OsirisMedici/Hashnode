### Learning by Doing
I think we can all agree, that projects are the best way to code. While there are plenty of tutorials, classes, and bits of information on the internet, there are no real guides on starting projects (without giving away all the answers).

The list of teaching techniques is ever-expanding, as there are multiple ways for us to gain knowledge. As a result, there are multiple techniques out there that leverage those particular skills. One such technique I want to share with you is learning by doing.

This technique has been around for a long time, and itâ€™s a surprisingly effective one thanks to the various perks that come with it. Also called experiential learning, Iâ€™ll be sharing with you my knowledge on the subject, what it is deep down, and why itâ€™s such an effective learning tool.

### What Is Learning by Doing?
Learning by doing is the simple idea that we are capable of learning more about something when we perform the action.

For example, say youâ€™re looking to play a musical instrument and were wondering how all of them sound and mix. In most other techniques, youâ€™d be playing the instrument all by yourself in a studio. Learning by doing instead gives you a basic understanding of how to play the instrument and puts you up on a stage to play an improvised piece with other musicians.

#### Benefits?
 1. Itâ€™s More Engaging and More Memorable
 2. It Is More Personal
 3. It Is Community-Connected
 4. Itâ€™s More Integrated Into Peopleâ€™s Lives
 5. It Builds Success Skills

## When I started

I'm currently a student, stuck at a shitty college for the next 3 years more, and I am looking for an internship or Community I can contribute and learn from that Experience. I don't have any experience. (5Â months ago)

### So that I can learn real skills by doing the work


 
Furthermore, I can work for 10-12 hours a day, 7 days a week till i burn out, I really have nothing better to do. Not only that, but I don't know what job I should be looking for, though, but luckily today, I know where to start and in which direction I should keep my head towards.
### It All started 5 Months ago
Few Months before, When I took admission in college. After admission, I found that, In India we have colleges in tier list and I lie in a 3rd tier college means very few chances to work with big tech companies or startup or gaining any experience in the college time. It was very shocking and heartbreaking for me as a fresher. 
- No company will come in the campus
- we will be going here and there to find a job or a chance to gain experience by our own in shitty companies 
- Internships which will be giving by our college help where nothing to learn and guess what? We will be working 8-10 hours / day for free like a volunteer in those companies in the name of gaining experience.
- We were studying chemistry and cutting woods and metals even when we applied for computer science degree. I hate chemistry, man!! And I didn't came here to cut woods and metals

Curriculum was very dry and for one month, I didn't found a single student who has any interest in computer science, even my own batch mates who took AI-ML as addition subject in their degree. Nobody was thinking bigger. I thought maybe I'm a daydreamer and no future to work with my dream companies and big technologies.

Luckily, I met a student who was in my batch. Very shy and introvert, full of energy to learn, very optimistic, honest and hardworking. In short, I found a person just like me in the campus.
We started sharing to each other all the knowledge we knew at that time about tech and programming. He introduced me to very good practices, tech stack, technologies and remote job culture, and I was blown at that time by knowing all this exists in this tiny world.

[Nikhil](https://twitter.com/Nikhilhvr) introduced me to a person Kunal Kushwaha on the internet and that time Kunal was arranging an online hackathon for students that was so fascinating. And from him, we discover more people like him doing Awesome work in public and sharing experiences on the Internet, what they have done and what we should too.
All of that was very eye-opening and shocking at the same time.
### Pay Attention, maybe you find something you are missing in your equation or in your recipe 
[Kunal-kushwaha](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt),
[Gaurav Sen](https://twitter.com/gkcs_), [Eddie Jaoude](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude) and many more. 
These people helped me to see a new world. They gave me a hope to open my eyes always and stand strong with my shoulders back.
"I think the best thing you can do or give a person is HOPE, and these guys did a fabulous job in it."

- Making free courses
- career guiding 
- introducing students to great people by podcast and interviews 
- telling us what we shouldn't do 
- And where to turn our head and seek for skills more than any degree or certificate 

All of this is like revolution and I see myself in them somewhere, and I will help my Juniors too to see all of these opportunities and skill mindset I promise.
I highly recommend following all these people for your own self-interest.
You want to do big in tech industry, then follow right people.

Journey started January 2022, Nikhil and I made some 4 big projects and multiple small projects in just 3 months and learned ad studied dozens of tech stack and technologies to make those projects.

"Learning by doing is Something I strongly believe and share too."

- 
Now when we are done studying basic of programming and developed ourselves to understand any tech stack and start again & again after falling multiple time. it's time for upgrading to the new level. 

We created, developed and design, and now it's time for contributing to open source and different communities with our knowledge.

Our 2nd projects was a chatbot application who wasn't able to speak or listen any voice. It was our baby, like a 2-month human baby. Then we implemented another application with AI technology who can speak and answer and run different tasks just by listening to our voices. And eyes of people light up whenever someone listen to his voice. 
I learned a lesson from AI ALPHA (our 3rd big project) ---- "If you will not speak for yourself, then you can't charm anybody"

Documenting myself and my work and journey is the another thing I can do with contributing to communities. 

If you are a student like me from a tier-3 college and no clue what to do and where to start. I will highly recommend you kunal Kushwaha's  this YouTube video. It will help you to understand better.
